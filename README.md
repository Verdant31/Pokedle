<h3>üìö Resume</h3>
Pokedle is a dle game style, but of Pokemons (A dle game is basically a guessing game, one of the best known games of this style that influenced the creation of several others is Wordle, in Wordle you have to guess a 5-letters word randomly generated every day).
<br>
The game basically has two modes: "Classic" and "FInd out".
<h4>Classic</h4>
In classic mode, every day a Pokemon will be randomly chosen as the Pokemon of the day. Here, every time you try to guess the Pokemon, a card will appear on the screen, showing a comparison between the Pokemon you chose and the Pokemon of the day. This comparison is done by looking at Skills, Moves, Types, Weight, Height, HP, Attack and Speed. (Example in the first photo).

The result of the comparison can be Correct, Partially correct and Incorrect. (Intuitively, you win when all attributes are correct)

<h4>Find out</h4
I created the Find out mode so that if the person enjoyed playing the game, they wouldn't have to wait until the next day to play again. So here, a Pokemon is chosen every time you reload the page or enter the game. The main difference between it and the Classic is that it does not have that elaborate comparison, you have only 5 tips that you can OPTIONALLY ask for. (Example in the second photo).<br>
